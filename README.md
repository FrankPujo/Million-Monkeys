# Million-Monkeys
Project to demonstrate that infinite monkeys with keyboards would write all Shakespeare poems... but small.  
To use: change the _word_ variable.  
Currently only the latin alphabet lowercase letters are used, but you can change it from the _letters_ variable.
My suggestion is to start with a 2 letter word and then get longer ones, to see your computer reaction. Of course do multiple tests for each step, because they have a huge variability (from 30,000 to 9 for 2 letters).
